## Preface

Cloud storage for photos and videos is expensive and a pain in the ass.  From my experience, there's no better photo manager out there than Google Photos (convince me otherwise).  I'm too deeply invested in the Google ecosystem that it would be impossible for me today to move all my thousands of photos off to another provider.  From Pixel 1-5, Google Photos had offered free unlimited full original quality photo uploads which deeply secured those users from never leaving the platform.

This all changed with Pixel 6.  The glory days of unlimited uploads has ending and expired.  My Pixel 3 free uploads ended this year and now I'm left in the dark with only one option: Invest more into the system, and buy Google One storage.

Well, I'm too f'ing cheap to pay for storage, I'm too lazy to delete photos, and I keep literally everything I shoot.  This has accumulated terabytes of current data usage + all the future photos and videos I'll be taking that needs a home.

Enter a small loophole: Pixel 1.  This phone is the only pixel left that will retain unlimited photo upload forever.  That is, any photos and videos that are uploaded from this device to Google Photos can be uploaded at full quality and will not count towards your Google storage limit.

I am proposing a solution that will allow a photographer's workflow that goes from Camera -> Transfer files to computer -> automatically upload files to Pixel -> Pixel syncs photos to Google Photos -> Clean up.

I'm suppperrr lazy and I have photos on my camera from ages ago because it's a pain for me to manually copy files from my camera to the phone.  And if the phone is full, I'd have to wait for the Pixel to upload, then go in and manually delete photos from the phone.

With this workflow, I just need to take my SD card and move all the files to my computer, and my solution will just automate the rest, greatly simplifying the manual aspect, while retaining unlimited photo and video cloud storage.  Forever.  All it costs is $100 for a used Pixel 1 on the market.
